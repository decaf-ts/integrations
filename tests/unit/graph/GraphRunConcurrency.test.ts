/**
 * @module integrations/tests/unit/graph/GraphRunConcurrency
 * @summary SAA-595 regression tests: per-caller concurrency buckets
 * (scenario 2 of the SAA-608 review follow-up).
 * @description Drives {@link GraphRunService} directly (engine-level, no
 * HTTP) with `limits.maxConcurrentRuns: 1` and a blocking node executor, and
 * pins the per-caller bucket semantics the SAA-595 hardening introduced:
 * - a caller exhausting their own bucket does not affect other callers:
 *   bob and distinct `ip:`-keyed anonymous callers still create runs while
 *   alice's bucket is full;
 * - the second createRun for a full bucket rejects with the
 *   `... per caller is exhausted` validation error;
 * - after a run reaches a terminal state and the `eventReplayWindowMs`
 *   auto-release fires, the caller's bucket is free again;
 * - the internal bookkeeping maps (`activeByCaller`, `callerKeysByRun`,
 *   `releaseTimers`) return to empty — no per-caller or per-run leak.
 *
 * The blocking executor gates on actual executor entry (not creation time),
 * so "bucket exhausted" is asserted against provably in-flight runs.
