/**
 * Canonical workflow persistence model (DECAF-50 §4.10).
 *
 * `document` is the executable source of truth. `snapshot` is retained
 * temporarily (DECAF-50 §4.18 transition) so legacy persisted snapshots keep
 * loading through lossless read-path conversion; it must never become the
 * executable source of truth again and is removed at cutover (P7).
 *
 * `owner` implements the DECAF-48 `{ workflowId, ownerUser }` ownership tuple:
 * the authenticated user that created the workflow, or `undefined` for
 * system/standalone saves (tolerated per DECAF-48 §4.15).
