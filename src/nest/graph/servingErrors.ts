 * (non-Decaf, non-`HttpException`) failure reaching the graph serving
 * controllers' catch-all error mappers. The client receives a constant generic
 * `500` body ({@link GRAPH_SERVING_INTERNAL_ERROR_MESSAGE}); the underlying
 * error message and stack plus the request correlation ids (`runId` /
 * `workflowId`) are logged server-side only, so adapter internals (connection
 * strings, credentials, table/column names, driver text) never reach the client.

 * Logs an unmapped graph serving failure server-side, with the request
 * correlation ids and the underlying error message/stack. The client receives the
 * constant generic {@link GRAPH_SERVING_INTERNAL_ERROR_MESSAGE} instead; this log
 * is the only place the underlying error detail is surfaced.
 *
 * The correlation ids are serialized directly into the log message (via
 * `JSON.stringify`) rather than relying solely on the logger's `meta` channel. The
 * default RAW log pattern has no `{meta}` placeholder, so a `meta`-only
 * correlation would never render under default text logging; inlining it keeps the
 * ids visible under any renderer, and JSON escaping preserves the no-log-injection
 * property.
 *
 * The whole body is guarded so a hostile thrown value (e.g. a throwing `toString`
 * on the caught value) or a logging-infrastructure failure can never make this
 * mapper throw; failures are swallowed because Nest's default handler still answers
 * the constant generic `500` fail-securely.
 *

 * @param {unknown} e - The caught error that was not mapped to a specific HTTP status.
 * @param {GraphServingErrorCorrelation} [correlation] - Request correlation ids, when known.
