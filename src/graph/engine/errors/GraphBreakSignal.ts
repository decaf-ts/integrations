 * @description Thrown by the Break node executor and caught by the enclosing
 * loop executor (`core.loop.foreach`, `core.loop.while`, `core.loop.until`).
 * Unlike a real error, a break signal is a cooperative control-flow token: it
 * is NOT propagated as a workflow failure. When caught, the loop terminates
 * early and returns the results collected so far (plus the optional `value`
 * carried by the signal as the final partial result).
