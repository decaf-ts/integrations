/**
 * @module integrations/graph/engine/runs/types
 * @summary Graph run lifecycle contracts (engine side).
 * @description Engine-scoped run contracts for the lifecycle subsystem
 * (DECAF-50 §4.14–§4.16). The frontend-safe run wire contract —
 * `GraphRunStatus`, `GraphRunEventEnvelope`, `GraphRunEventEnvelopeInput`
 * and the run limits/terminal predicates — lives in
 * `../shared/{types,constants}` and is re-exported here so backend consumers
 * keep a single `@decaf-ts/integrations/graph` surface.
 *
 * Engine-only contracts: the full {@link GraphRun} shape (whose `result?`
 * carries engine dates) and the run store/event-store/create-request/
 * document-resolver ports.
