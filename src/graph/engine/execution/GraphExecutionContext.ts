/**
 * @module integrations/graph/execution/GraphExecutionContext
 * @summary Decaf Context for graph node execution (DECAF-50 §4.9).
 * @description Extends Decaf's {@link Context} so node executors receive the
 * same contextual plumbing as task handlers. The context carries the
 * canonical workflow document, the executing node's canonical instance, and
 * its effective resolved manifest — never a raw node definition. Executors
 * use the context to emit progress, log messages, and report state through
 * the engine's observer pipeline. Each context also exposes a run-scoped
 * `ctx.logger` (DECAF-48 §4.3) bound to the executing node's `runId` /
 * `workflowId` / `nodeId` / `user`, so every log line streams over
 * `graph.run.log` with the DECAF-9 custom attributes.
